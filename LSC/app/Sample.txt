Text: Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, Second Edition, by Jiawei Han and Micheline Kamber,
Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2006.
Course Content: Introduction to basic data mining techniques (such as association rules mining, cluster
analysis, and classification methods) and big data mining applications (such as Web data mining,
bioinformatics, health informatics, social networks and security). Hands-on programming projects.
Prerequisite: CSc 3410 Data Structures.
Course Requirements: All students should not only learn basic theoretical principles but also accumulate
practical hands-on experience. Undergraduate students and graduate students will do assignments, take
tests and finish programming projects. At the end of this semester, all graduate students and
undergraduate students will give presentations to share knowledge and skills. An undergraduate student
needs to write a technical paper with IEEE format (3 or more pages). A graduate student needs to write a
conference paper with IEEE format (4 or more pages).
Class Policy:
 Attendance: Students are required to attend all classes.
 Academic honesty: Plagiarism will result in a score of zero on the test or paper. The instructor has
the right to make a decision.
 Assignments and Projects: They must be handed in on time and will not be accepted when past due.
 Withdrawals: March 1 Tuesday is the last day to withdraw and possibly receive a W.
 Make-ups: need the instructor's special permission.
Grading Policy:
